- **Component:** `src/components/Events.tsx`
- **Interface:** Updated to match API response (camelCase fields)
- **Status:** Complete and tested

### 2. Opening Hours API Migration ✓
- **Endpoint:** `https://debramin-events-api-ftdcatd6gzdtcbbj.westeurope-01.azurewebsites.net/api/openinghours`

## 📊 Architecture Changes

### Before
```
Components
    ↓
React Query
    ↓
Azure SDK (@azure/data-tables, @azure/storage-blob)
    ↓
Azure Table Storage (with SharedKey authentication)
```

### After
```
Components
    ↓
React Query
    ↓
Simple fetch() calls
    ↓
REST API (debramin-events-api)
```

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Events
1. Events component mounts
2. React Query calls `fetchEvents()`
3. Simple fetch to REST API endpoint
4. Returns Event[] sorted by eventDate
5. Component renders event cards

### Opening Hours
1. Contact component mounts
2. React Query calls `fetchOpeningHours()`
3. Simple fetch to REST API endpoint
4. Returns OpeningHour[] sorted by dayOfWeek
5. Component renders opening hours table

## 📈 Code Reduction

| Component | Before | After | Reduction |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| fetchEvents() | 60+ lines | 25 lines | 58% |
| fetchOpeningHours() | 60+ lines | 25 lines | 58% |
| **Total** | **120+ lines** | **50 lines** | **58%** |

## 🔧 Interface Changes

### Event Interface
```typescript
// Before
{ id, title, description, event_date, location, created_at, updated_at }

// After
{ title, description, location, eventDate, partitionKey, rowKey }
```

### OpeningHour Interface
```typescript
// Before
{ id, day_of_week, day_name, open_time, close_time, is_closed, notes, created_at, updated_at }

// After
{ dayOfWeek, dayName, openTime, closeTime, isClosed, partitionKey, rowKey }
```
