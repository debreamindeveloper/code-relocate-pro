## üß™ Manual Testing Steps

### Step 1: Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Events Section
- Open browser to `http://localhost:5173`
- Scroll to Events section
- Verify events are loading

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Go to Console tab
- Verify no errors are displayed
- Look for successful API call logs

### Step 4: Verify Event Display
- [ ] Events are displayed in cards
- [ ] Event titles are visible
- [ ] Event descriptions are visible
- [ ] Event dates are formatted correctly
- [ ] Event locations are visible
- [ ] Events are sorted by date

### Step 5: Check Network Tab
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Go to Network tab
- Refresh page
- Look for API call to `debramin-events-api-ftdcatd6gzdtcbbj.westeurope-01.azurewebsites.net/api/events`
- Verify response status is 200
- Verify response contains event data

### Step 6: Test Error Handling
- Temporarily modify API URL to invalid endpoint
- Verify error message is displayed
- Verify error is logged to console
- Revert API URL change

## üìã Files Changed Summary

| File | Changes | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `src/integrations/azure/storageService.ts` | Updated Event interface, replaced fetchEvents() | ‚úÖ |
| `src/components/Events.tsx` | Updated property references | ‚úÖ |
| `src/integrations/azure/config.ts` | Created in root | ‚úÖ |
| `src/integrations/azure/index.ts` | Created in root | ‚úÖ |

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm run build`
- [ ] Verify no console errors in development
- [ ] Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify API endpoint is accessible from production environment
- [ ] Monitor API response times
- [ ] Set up error tracking/monitoring
- [ ] Document API endpoint in team wiki

## üìù Notes

- The Events API is now independent of Azure Table Storage
- No connection string configuration needed for events
- Opening hours still use Azure Table Storage (unchanged)
- All other components remain unchanged
- Build size remains optimal

## ‚ú® Success Criteria

- [x] Build completes without errors
- [x] Events component imports from correct location
- [x] Event interface matches API response format
- [x] fetchEvents() makes simple REST API call
- [x] No Azure SDK dependencies for events
- [x] Error handling is in place
- [x] TypeScript types are correct
